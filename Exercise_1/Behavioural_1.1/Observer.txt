Observer Pattern:

Key Concepts:
Observer interface for followers.
Subject interface for the social media account (or any observable).
Concrete implementations of observers (e.g., followers) and subjects (e.g., social media account).
Observers (followers) are notified whenever the subject (account) updates, such as posting new content.
